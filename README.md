## Website running local on Windows using Visual Studio

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Click `F5`.

# Website running in Azure
## 1. Create Web App in Azure
First, we need to create the Web App where our website will be running on.

We'll do this using Azure CLI @ shell.azure.com. This way we don't need to deal with authentication.

1. Login to shell.azure.com
2. Remember to be in Powershell mode
3. Let's define required variables / configuration settings in the shell.
```
$ResourceGroup = 'WebAppResourceGroup'
$Location = 'westeurope'
$appserviceplanname = 'agbodenseappplan'
$webappname = 'agbodensesuperapp'
$Sku = 'F1'
```
4. Create a Resource group, the logical container for the web app.
```
az group create `
    --name $ResourceGroup `
    --location $location
```
5. Create the App Service Plan within the resource group.
The App Service Plan is a "container" in which your web apps will be created.
You can create more than one web app in a single App Service Plan.
```
az appservice plan create `
    --name $appserviceplanname `
    --resource-group $ResourceGroup `
    --sku $Sku
```
6. Now we create our webapp 
```
az webapp create `
    --name $webappname `
    --resource-group $ResourceGroup `
    --plan $appserviceplanname
```
7. Visit your new empty website
```
The url for your website will be https://$webappname.azurewebsites.net
```

## 2. Upload website to the newly created web app using VS Code

1. Open your terminal in VS code and type `dotnet publish` - you need to be in the website folder for this to work.
2. Open your Azure Pane to the left and under "App Services" click the fancy "Deploy to Web App" and follow the guide. When you're selecting what to deploy, browse to this folder: `..Global-Azure-Bootcamp-2019-Odense/GacBootcampWebsite/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish/`
3. When it's done publishing your website, VS Code will give you a direct url for your website.
4. Profit

## 3. Upload website to the newly created web app using Visual Studio

1. Right click your solution, click `Publish` and follow the guide.

You're now ready to extend your newly created website!


# Where do i find the exercises?

We've created a branch and (perhaps?) a pull request (pr) for each exercise there is.
You can either click the pr and see the documentation for the task or browse the branches itself.

If there's no pr for a branch the documentation is in the menu point for your exercise.

For example - you want to work on KeyVault.
You select the pr named `Implement KeyVault for accessing the secret on the page` and follow the instructions on how to create a KeyVault.
Then you can see what you need to implement for your site in the given pr under `Files changed`

## What exercises can I work on?

You can extend your site with the following technologies:
* Application Insights
* Azure Functions
* KeyVault
* Storage
* Database
* ServiceBus + Azure Functions
